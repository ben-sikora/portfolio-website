# Ben Sikora's Portfolio
My own website to host my portfolio. The site is a single page React App built with Vite. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS. Everything was written and styled by myself--I did not follow a tutorial or use boostrap. This project taught me a great deal about design, website responsiveness, and React Hooks and State.
