                Hello! My name is Ben. I like learning and building cool things. 
                <br/>
                I graduated from Georgetown University in 2022. During school, my main focus was on data science. I spent a year as the head analyst of the worldâ€™s largest student-run non-profit and built many machine learning and AI algorithms from scratch. 
                <br/>
                More recently, however, I have shifted my focus on web apps and cloud technologies. I am working towards completing my AWS cloud certification and have deployed my first Full-Stack apps. 
                <br/>
                As a lifelong learner, curiosity has always been at the center of my personality. With each new line of code, bug, or project, I build a new understanding of what I want to create and how I want to build it. I am a driven, passionate, and clever engineer that is always looking to build the next great thing. 

                </p>
