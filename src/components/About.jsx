                Hello! My name is Ben. It's nice to meet you!
                I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Georgetown University looking to start my career in Software Development. I created this website to illustrate some of my recent projects and also to share a little bit about me. 
                <br/>
                <br />
                During school, my main focus was on 
                <span className='text-yellow font-bold'> data science</span>. 
                I spent a year as the head analyst at the world's largest 
                <span className='text-yellow font-bold'> student-run non-profit</span>  and spent time learning and building various ML models. More recently, I have shifted my focus to 
                <span className='text-yellow font-bold'> web apps and cloud technology. </span> 
                I am working towards completing my AWS cloud certification and have deployed my first Full-Stack apps. 
                <br/>
                <br />
                Curious what I have been up to in the past year? Check out my blog!
